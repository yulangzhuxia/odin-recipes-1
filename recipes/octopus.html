    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Above and beyond the ingredients in this octopus recipe, the cooking
      method, or should I say methods, couldn't be easier. As long as you braise
      it gently on low heat, until just tender, and then give it a nice sear
      before serving, you should be in great shape. This smoky braised octopus
      is great served with crusty roasted potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>Simple and delicious!</p>

      <li>1 large bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons smoked Spanish paprika</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>½ cup white wine</li>
      <li>1 (1 pound) piece Spanish octopus</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>⅓ cup braising liquid</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>

      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Place onion, garlic, bay leaf, paprika, salt, and 1 tablespoon olive oil
        into a saucepan. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until onions start
        to soften, about 5 minutes. Add white wine to create the braising
        liquid. Bring to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer octopus into braising liquid, turning to coat with the liquid.
        Cover; reduce heat to low. Simmer 20 minutes and turn octopus over.
        Continue cooking until octopus is tender, another 40 to 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat; transfer octopus to a large bowl. Pour braising liquid
        over octopus. Place bowl above a bowl of ice water to cool to room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover bowl with plastic wrap when octopus and liquid are cool.
        Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer octopus to a work surface and mop off braising juices with
        paper towels; remove as much of the purple skin as you want. Cut octopus
        into 3 or 4 serving-size pieces. Brush with olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer braising liquid to saucepan. Bring to a boil; remove from heat.
        Strain out solids; transfer liquid to a mixing bowl; let cool about 10
        minutes. Stir in lemon juice, extra-virgin olive oil, salt, and cayenne
        pepper to make the serving sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to high heat. Transfer octopus pieces
        to grill. Cook until flesh is seared, almost charred, 3 or 4 minutes.
        Turn and cook other side until dark brown, caramelized, and heated
        through, another 3 or 4 minutes. Transfer to a platter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice octopus into fairly thick diagonal slices. Place on a serving
        dish. Spoon braising liquid mixture over the top. Dust with a bit of
        cayenne pepper, if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
