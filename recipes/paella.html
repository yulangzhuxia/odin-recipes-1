    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in paella pan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and
        pepper; cook and stir for a few minutes. Add chorizo sausage, diced
        chicken, and rice; cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in 3 ½ cups stock,
        wine, thyme leaves, and saffron. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to
        the boil, and simmer for 15 minutes; stir occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the rice, and check to see if it is cooked. If the rice is
        uncooked, stir in ½ cup more stock. Continue cooking, stirring
        occasionally. Stir in additional stock if necessary: use up to 2 cups
        additional stock, 5 cups total. Cook until rice is done.

        and mussels on top. Cover with foil, and leave for 3 to 5 minutes.
